    <h4>HYACINTH HALVEY BY Lady Augusta Gregory_</h4>
    <P>
       <p class="speech"><h5 class= "MRS.DELANE">MR.DELANE.</h5> I suppose so. It's hard enough on myself to be down ready
        for the mail-car in the morning, sorting letters in the half-dark. It's
        often I haven't time to look who are the letters from--or the cards.</p><br>
        
       <P class="speech"><h5 class="MR.QUIRKE"> MR. QUIRKE. </h5> It would be a pity you not to know any little news might be
        knocking about. If you did not have information of what is going on, who
        should have it? Was it you, ma'am, was telling me that the new
        sub-sanitary inspector would be arriving to-day?</P><br>
        
       <p class="speech"><h5 class="MRS. DELANE">MRS DELAN.</h5> To-day it is he is coming, and it's likely he was in that
        train. There was a card about him to Sergeant Carden this morning.</p><br>
        
       <p class="speech"><h5 class=" MR. QUIRKE">MR.QUIRKE.</h5> A young chap from Carrow they were saying he was.</p><br>
        
       <P class="speech"><h5 class="MRS.DELANE"> MR.DELENA.</h5> MRS. DELANE. So he is, one Hyacinth Halvey; and indeed if all that is
        said of him is true, or if a quarter of it is true, he will be a credit
        to this town.</P><br>
        
        <p class="speech"> <h5 class="MR. QUIRKE.">MR.QUIRKE </h5>" Is that so?</P><br>
        
       <P CLASS="speech"><h5 class="MRS. DELANE.">MRS.DELANE</h5>" Testimonials he h as by the score. To Father Gregan they
        were sent. Registered they were coming and going. Would you believe me
        telling you that they weighed up to three pounds?</P><br>
        
       <p class="speech"><h5 class="MR. QUIRKE.">MR. QUIRKE</h5>" There must be great bulk in them indeed.</p><br>
        
      <p class="speech"><h5 class="MRS. DELANE.">MRS.DELANE.</h5>" It is no wonder he to get the job. He must have a great
        character, so many persons to write for him as what there did.</p><br>
        
       <p class="speech"><h5 class=" FARDY">FRADY</h5>. It would be a great thing to have a character like that.</p><br>
        
       <p class="speech"><h5 class="MRS. DELANE.">MRS.DELANE.</h5> Indeed, I am thinking it will be long before you will get
        the like of it, Fardy Farrell.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p class="speech"><h5 class="FARDY">FRADY</h5>. If I had the like of that of a character it is not here carrying
        messages I would be. It's in Noonan's Hotel I would be, driving cars.</P><br>
        
        <p class="speech"><h5 class="MR. QUIRKE.">MR.QUIRKE</h5>Here is the priest's housekeeper coming.</p><br>
        
       <p class="speech"><h5 class="MRS.DELANE"> MRS. DELANE.</h5> So she is; and there is the sergeant a little while after
        her.</p><br>
        
            <p class="directions"> [_Enter_ MISS JOYCE. </P>
        
        
        <p class="directions"><h5 class="MISS JOYCE.">MISS.JOYCE</h5> It's easy to say let him mind himself. What do you say to
        him going to the meeting to-night?</p><br>
        
          <p class="directions">  [SERGEANT _comes in_.</p><br>
        
       <p class="speech"><h5 class="MISS JOYCE"> MISS JOYCE. </h5>It's for his reverence's "Freeman" I am come, Mrs. Delane.</p><br>
        
        <p class="speech"><h5 class="MRS. DELANE.">MRS.DELANE</h5>" Here it is ready. I was just throwing an eye on it to see
        was there any news. Good evening, Sergeant.</p><br>
        
        <p class="directions"> [_Holding up a placard._]</p> I brought this notice,
        <p class="speech"><h5 class="Mrs. Delane,">MRS.Delane</h5>
        the announcement of the meeting to be held to-night in the court-house.
        You might put it up here convenient to the window. I hope you are coming
        to it yourself?</p><br>
